## Introduction 

BabySafeMoon is a piece to be written in the history books, a rocket with revolutionary mechanics and an achievable opportunity to reach $1 per token. 

BabySafeMoon is a rocketship designed to launch and land on the moon. While many projects promise "to the moon" and "hitting a dollar", BabySafeMoon is engineered to accomplish that mission realistically. 
The project's uniqueness comes from robust financial tokenomics, revolutionary mechanics and intelligent marketing, and when we succeed; the project, the astronauts, and the team will be celebrating with bottles of champagne on the moon ($1).

### Tokenomics

The project's tokenomics work differently to the usual token or cryptocurrency. We engineered the tokenomics to work in best combination with the token's mechanics. An independent base core tax assures off-contract automatic adaptation of buying and selling using market trends and simple statistics (slopes and linear regression).

### Mechanics 

The mechanics of BabySafeMoon are in-place with support of unique tokenomics to provide investors and the market with a complete token trading system geared towards achieving the goals of the project and the community.
